# SofCorrect - Text Document Fixer

This is a simple server-side JavaScript application that I made as a gift for my girlfriend that fixes common issues in text documents. Currently, it does the following:

- Adds a space after commas and ends of sentances if one is not already present
- Capitalizes the first letter of sentences after periods
- Capitalizes single "I"s
- Fixes bulleted lists by ensuring each bullet point ends with a period, and is spaced correctlly
- 
There are some other hidden features that I will not disclose here, but leave for a user to discover
